     # Login to Netlify
     netlify login
     
     # Link your project
     netlify link
     
     # Start development server with Netlify Functions
     netlify dev
     ```
   - Add your API keys to Netlify:
     ```bash
     netlify env:set OPENAI_API_KEY your_actual_api_key_here
     ```

3. **Run Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### 3. Deployment Setup

#### GitHub Setup
1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Push your code:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

#### Netlify Deployment
1. **Connect to Netlify:**
   - Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Choose your Parkify repository

2. **Configure Build Settings:**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Node version: `18`

3. **Add Environment Variables in Netlify:**
